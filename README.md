# Text-To-Image-Generator
Built a real-time website for image generation using gan-cls algorithm. The algorithm is trained on CUBS 200 birds dataset.

Model is trained for 800 epochs. The resolution is 64*64. The model might generate irrelevant images in some cases because of the real world text. 

Used google's Pre-trained Word2Vec Model for taking custom input and converting it into numerical format.
